Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

2.151 or equivalent exposure to physical system modeling.

Course Description
------------------

This course is about Modeling multi-domain engineering systems at a level of detail suitable for design and control system implementation. It also describes Network representation, state-space models, Multiport energy storage and dissipation, Legendre transforms, Nonlinear mechanics, transformation theory, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian forms, Control-relevant properties. The application examples may include electro-mechanical transducers, mechanisms, electronics, fluid and thermal systems, compressible flow, chemical processes, diffusion, and wave transmission.

Grading Policy
--------------

### Homework

About 6 homework problems will be assigned throughout the term at approximately two-week intervals.

### Term Project

Students will be required to select a term project by Lec #8. A brief interim progress report will be required by Lec #16. Term projects must be completed by the last week of the term, at which time a final report will be due. A brief oral presentation of each term project will also be required.

Ethics Policy
-------------

### Collaboration

Collaboration on and discussion of homework assignments is encouraged but **each student must submit an individual solution**. Collaboration on term projects is encouraged provided that some means for clearly identifying individual contributions is proposed and approved by the instructor.

### Use of Material from Previous Years

Use of material from prior offerings of this subject in preparing homework assignments defeats the purpose of the assignments and is forbidden.
